This directory contains the original MapsForge source code for the
core and maps module at the time of porting it. It is distributed
for the case that the maven repository (boundlessgeo.com) purges
the MapsForge modules or one wants to compile it without maven.

The content of this directory shall not be modified, replacing the
it with a new MapsForge copy is the only accepted way of change.


The original android source code has been moved from org.mapsforge.android.*
to  de.itd.mapsforge.javafx.* and modified to fit the JavaFX needs.
